## Raw Waveform Based End-to-End Deep Convolutional Network For Spatial Localization Of Multiple ACcoustic Sources

This repository holds code for the final year thesis project at PESIT - Bangalore South Campus. 

In this project we will implement an end-to-end deep convolutional neural network operating on multi-channel raw audio data to localize multiple simultaneously active acoustic sources in space as proposed by Harshavardhan Sundar, Weiran Wang, Ming Sun and Chao Wang in [1]. It makes use of a novel encoding scheme to represent the spatial coordinates of multiple sources, which facilitates 2D localization of multiple sources in an end-to-end fashion. We aim to experiment and test our implementation of this novel method.
